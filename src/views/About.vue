      Everyday our lives are governed by habit.<br/>
      These habits are the little routines and small ways
      of doing things.<br/> Most people are unaware
      or are only slightly aware that
      they’re doing them.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some habits, like smoking, can have harmful
      effects on your health; others like
      procrastination can affect your work
      and career.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore it’s important to take back control.<br/>
      This can be extremely hard, some habits after
      all are so ingrained that we do
      them without thinking.<br/>
      Luckily there are many habits tracking
      apps available especially designed
      to help you to set goals,<br/>
      keep track of your habits and
      tackle your bad habits for free.<br/>
